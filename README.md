> With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, its easy to see how a greek life house will have many issues as there are over 100+ members in ZBT. To help track when people enter the house as well as their guests I developed this python program. The program will prompt first time users to enter their names which will be saved for future use. A ding will then sound if the user successfully swipes in! It will ask you to try again if the swipe is invalid! The program also as an admin page where an admin can query information based off Month, Day, and as well as search by Student ID.
